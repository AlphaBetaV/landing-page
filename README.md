# landing-page
The Odin Project landing page assignment

Created the architecture for a landing page which could have be transformed into a page on any topic.

Used flexbox to organize this page into different containers and resized the containers to fit different sizes based on the type of content the TOP template advised me to initially use.

This page was designed for most of layout placement to be done through flexbox and then (width or height): px; operations were used to move tricky containers into more aesthetically appealing positions.

The main things I learned from this project up to this stage was:
-Compartamentalization of different aspects of an html page so that different sections could be worked on iteratively through the use usage of containers and its subdivisions, to control space and placement.
-Incorporating different units of measurement like %, vh, vw and px to control the height and width of objects.
-Understanding how class and inheritance operate within CSS related to parent and child properties.
-Visualizing a design, creating the overall html infrastructure to support it and then drilling down to add more details with CSS
-Using developer tools to inspect what I was building throughout the process, especially when I was confused because I was trying to implement was not working, and then slowly using trial and error through inspect to figure out the solution.
-Using google to start looking for other functions or methodologies that could fulfill my intention.

Some of the things I struggled with up to this stage are:
-Using the correct tool, especially when considering how the parent container is actually affecting the child.
-Resizing an image within CSS, instead of using photoshop to create an asset that size.
-Efficient usage of containers. I have a lot of containers.
